- ⚒️ I'm currently working on designing and deploying an Azure Virtual Desktop environment, exploring the possibilities with Microsoft Teams chatbots and migrating a Cisco UCS environment to new hardware. As usual, PowerShell where possible :)
- 📖 I'm currently learning the intricacies of the Azure Bot Framework, and furthering my knowledge of Microsoft Graph.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robinmalik) / [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/iamrobinmalik).
