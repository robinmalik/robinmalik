### Hi there 👋

- ⚒️ I'm currently working on designing and deploying Ansible with Ansible Semaphore, refactoring internal codebases and ensuring use of CI/CD, exploring the possibilities with Microsoft Teams chatbots and training new staff within our Platforms section. As usual, PowerShell where possible :)
- 📖 I'm currently learning the intricacies of the Azure Bot Framework, and furthering my knowledge of Microsoft Graph.
